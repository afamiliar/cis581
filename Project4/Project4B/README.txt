The folder "Part1" contains the code for section 1 (Functional layers implementation). In the main script, there are different labeled sections for each question (numbered 1-3 corresponding to questions 1-3 in the handout), however each section must be run consecutively in order to work properly.

The folder "Part21" contains the code & datasets for section 2.1 (Experiment with fully connected network). There is one training script for each question in the handout, which are labeled accordingly (e.g. p21_1_train.py for question 1, p21_2_train.py for question 2, etc.)

The folder "Part22" contains code & datasets for section 2.2 (Experiment with convolutional network).
