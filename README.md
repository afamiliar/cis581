# cis581

Personal code for CIS 581 Computational Photography & Computer Vision (Fall 2017) graduate course at University of Pennsylvania. Each directory corresponds to a different assignment, with a PDF of the assignment statement and subdirectories with code and input/output files.

<br/> hw1: Matlab code for image filtering, convolution, kernel estimation, and edge moving

<br/> Project1: Matlab code for a Canny edge detector - gradient computation, local maximum detection (non-max suppression), and edge linking (hysteresis)

<br/> Project2: Matlab code for image blending (gradient domain blending) and morphing (via triangulation), extra credit assignments of image morphing via thin plate spline, and advanced face blending.

<br/> Project3A: Matlab code for seam carving (minimizing cumulative energy of removed seams) and discrete image resizing

<br/> Project3B: Matlab code for mini-project (using morphing and texture blending to create novel object images)

<br/> Project3C: Matlab code for video mosaicing (feature detection, feature matching, RANSAC, frame mosaicing via gradient domain blending)

<br/> Project4A: Python code for optical flow of faces in videos (face detection, feature detection, feature tracking, face tracking)

<br/> Project4B: Python code for convolutional neural network implementation (with different activation functions)

<br/> Project4C: Python code for automatic face swapping in videos (optical flow + CNN)
