# cis581

Personal code for CIS 581 Computational Photography & Computer Vision (Fall 2017) graduate course at University of Pennsylvania. Each directory corresponds to a different assignment, with a PDF of the assignment statement and subdirectories with code and input/output files.

hw1: Matlab code for image filtering, convolution, kernel estimation, and edge moving.
Project1: Matlab code for a Canny edge detector - gradient computation, local maximum detection (non-max suppression), and edge linking (hysteresis)
Project2: Matlab code for image blending (gradient domain blending) and morphing (via triangulation). Matlab code for extra credit assignments of image morphing via thin plate spline, and face blending video.
